# scratch-ml-models
"ML From Scratch" is a hands-on repository demonstrating the foundational implementation of Machine Learning models using pure Python and NumPy â€” without relying on libraries like Scikit-learn. This project is aimed at building a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.
